Here will be comments to everything done

About code:
- I know about helpers (absence of 'em'), understood it a bit late. It's completely my fault
- Ignored assertions directly to BD for checking created/updated gists (meaning strict request to BD) > needed much time on investigation of how to implement it

Test logic (test subject > objects to be tested > automation priority (all cases mentioned here have to be checked manually):
    Create gist
            - Happypath > highest
            - Input data validation to each field/pairwise > lowest
            - Missing field case (without "info" field 500 is received) > medium
            - Date field test (before/after currentdate) > lowest
    Get gist
            - Happypath > highest
            - Get gist w/o id > medium
            - Get gits with unexisting id > low  (in this case > it's case of getAllGists with highest)
            - Check data of gist received > highest
    Update existing gist
            - Happypath > highest
            - Input data validation to each field/pairwise > lowest
            - Missing field case (without "info" field 500 is received) > low (quiet duplicates create gist case)
            - Update gist w/o id > medium
            - Update gist with unexisting id > high (we might create new sometimes :) )
            - Check data of gist updated > highest (is performed after getting updated gist)
    Delete gist
            - Happypath > highest
            - Delete gist w/o id > high (we might delete multiple gists in this case)
            - Delete gist with unexisting id > low
    Get all gists
            - Happypath > highest
    Get all gists with valid until date paged
            - Happypath > high
            - Date used for paging check and array received > low

Notes: Errors have different time formatting ("timestamp" has ms)
