#This is the test task for automation QAs:

We have created a dynamically growing competitor to github's gist.
Thanks to our effort users can create notes which are valid until some date (see api spec), assign them categories (PROMO or INFO now, but we looking forward for more in our bright future!),
update already created ones, view all or valid until some date (with paging support) and not the day more. even DELTE is supported! 
We are constantly evolving with the marked so need to adapt quickly and our glorious devopses would like to know does these
changes break anything.

API documentation of our secure service can be found [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/726828d7c5308e3f7a31)
